    title: 'Metagenomic Analysis',
    description: 'Metagenomic analysis enables the identification of all genetic material present in a sample, allowing detection of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites without the need for traditional culture methods. This advanced approach is particularly useful for diagnosing complex or unknown infections, studying microbial communities, and conducting environmental or clinical microbiome research. Applications include infectious disease diagnosis, microbiome profiling, and antimicrobial resistance detection.',

    title: 'Embryonic DNA Screening',
    description: 'Embryonic DNA screening (Preimplantation Genetic Testing – PGT) analyzes embryos created through IVF to detect genetic abnormalities before implantation. It helps identify chromosomal abnormalities (PGT-A), single-gene disorders (PGT-M), or structural rearrangements (PGT-SR), improving implantation success rates and reducing the risk of genetic disease transmission.',

    title: 'Paternity Testing',
    description: 'Paternity testing is a DNA-based analysis used to determine biological parentage. The test compares specific genetic markers (STR loci) between the child and the alleged father to confirm or exclude biological relationship with a very high degree of accuracy. It is useful for legal, personal, and immigration purposes.',

    description: 'Used during pregnancy when both parents are carriers or at risk. Methods include: 1. Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) – Performed around 10–13 weeks. A small sample of placental tissue is analyzed for sickle cell mutations. 2. Amniocentesis – Performed around 15–20 weeks. Amniotic fluid is tested to detect fetal hemoglobin gene mutations. 3. Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT-M) – Conducted during IVF to screen embryos for sickle cell mutations before implantation.',
